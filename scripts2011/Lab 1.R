## CS&SS Intro to R
## Lab 1


## Working Directory
## What working directory are you in?

## Change your working directory to your personal folder for R work for this course.
## Open a new script, name it "lab 1.R", and save it in your personal folder.
## Save the code you write for this lab in the script.

## Basic Arithmetic in R

## Compute the log of 50

## Use the help system to find the exponential function

## Find the value of e

## Compute e to the tenth power.


## Vectors
## Run the following code (type CRTL+R) to create an income variable
## (thousands of dollars)
income = c(18,20,20.5, 22,28,30,36,36,37,38.5, 45, 46, 55, 55.5,58,59, 115, 367)

## how many observations are in this data set?

## what is the mean income?	

## what is the median income?

## Create a variable for the log of the income.

## Use help.search() to figure out how to make a histogram.

## Make a histogram of income

## Make a histogram of log(income)

## Use the help system to find out how to compute the tangent.

## compute the tangent of 1.57.

## plot the tangent function from 0 to 1.5

## save your R script to your personal directory.

## Type ls() to view everything in your workspace.

## save your workspace to your personal directory.
