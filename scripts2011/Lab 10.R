## Analysis of Variance

## Load the PlantGrowth data set

data(PlantGrowth)

## Look at data summaries

## Attach the data set

## Make side-by-side box plots of plant weight by group.

## Perform an analysis of variance to test whether the mean weight
## is different by group 


## t-tests

## Perform three separate t-tests to test which groups differ 
## significantly from each other


## Review

## Create the following matrix and name it A:

##       	40  	27
##		55	25

## Display the second column of A

## Display the second row of A

## With a single line of code, swap the two rows of A.
## (Hint: remember how we ordered data frames in lecture 4)

## With a single line of code, swap the two columns of A.

## Create the matrix B, which is A transposed, by B=t(A)
## Verify that this works.

## Compute the matrix product AB

## Compute the matrix C, such that each element of C is the product
## of the two corresponding elements in A and B.

## Suppose you have a variable X that follows a Poisson distribution with
## lambda = 10, and you want to compute the probability that X>15

## Use R help and/or your lecture notes to locate a function to do this,
## and perform the computation.
