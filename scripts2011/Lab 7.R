## Read in the states data set from the homework page of the class website.  Recall: this is a 
## CSV file, and the first column gives the rownames.  Read in the data set so that the first column
## is stored as rownames instead of as a variable.

## Attach the data set.

## Make a scatter plot of HS Graduation rate (y-axis) against life expectancy.

## Perform a linear regression of HS Graduation rate (y-axis) on life expectancy.

## Is the relationship statistically significant?

## Add the regression line to your scatter plot in red.


## Note that there are two outliers in the plot.  Use identify() to 
## identify which states these are.  

## Plot the residuals against fitted values and add a horizontal line at y=0.

## Is the assumption of constant variance met?

## Make a QQ normal plot of residuals and add a QQ line.


## Now go through the same process to explore the relationship between income and illiteracy.

## Plot Income (y-axis) against Illiteracy.

## Perform linear regression and add the regression line in red.

## Is the relationship statistically significant?

## There is one outlier in the plot: identify which state that is.  


## Plot the residuals against fitted values and add a horizontal line at y=0.

## Is the assumption of constant variance met?

## Make a QQ normal plot of residuals and add a QQ line.

## Now do the same regression, but omit the outlier.  Show this regression line on the same plot in blue.

## How much does the outlier shift the regression line?
