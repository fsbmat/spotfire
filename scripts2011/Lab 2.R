## Vectors

# Create a vector with values 0, 4, 8, 12, ..., 100; call it x

## retrieve the index for the value 52

# print the 12th value of x.

# Print the 12th and 13th values as follows: x[12:13]

# Print the 12th-20th values of x.

# In one command, print the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th values of x.


## Matrices

# Create a matrix with values 10, 20, ..., 1000 with 10 rows, call it y

# Display the third row

# Display the fourth and fifth columns

# Change the element in the 5th row, 5th column to 0.

# Type ?diagonal and try out this function.

# Display the diagonal elements of y

# Change the diagonal elements of y to be all 1's.



## Boolean variables

## Boolean variables contain TRUE and FALSE values.  R treats TRUE as 1 and FALSE as zero.
## Try this example: B = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
## sum(B)
## You can abbreviate TRUE with T and FALSE with F: B = c(T,T,F,F,T)


# Use rnorm to create a vector z, containing a sample of size 100 from a normal distribution with
# mean 20 and standard deviation 5

# Create a Boolean variable indicating which elements of z are greater than 23

# Create a Boolean variable indicating which elements of z are less than 20

# Create a Boolean variable called less.than.20 showing the indices for
#  the elements less than 20.

# How many elements are less than 20?
