 ## ADF, H0: series has a unit root
 # The general regression equation which incorporates a constant and a linear trend is

 # computed.

 adf.test(RCAN)

 # Augmented Dickey Fuller test (correct p-value)

    # The arguments of the function are as in the original adf.test function, i.e.
    # x    = a numeric vector or time series.
    # k    = the lag order to calculate the test statistic
    #        defaults to (n-1)^(1/3)
    # In addition, we have
    # int   = logical, a constant is included if int=T

 # where to many deterministic regressors included in step 1?
 # test for significance of the of the trend term by joint hypothesis

 # correct p-value from DF-table
 linearHypothesis.adf(lm1, c("xD.lag(x, -1)", "xtime(x)"))
 # We can not reject H0. -> Coeffient of time-trend is zero
 
# Step 3: If null is not rejected, estimate model without trend

# Step 4: If null is not rejected, estimate a model without drift and trend
 adf.test.1(x=RCAN, int=F, trend=F, k=0)
 # -> null is not rejected
 # -> series contains a unit root
